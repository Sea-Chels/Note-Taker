# Note-Taker

## Description

The goal with this application was to get used to express routes and creating post, delete and get routes. It was challenging connecting code to something that was already partially written, but through looking at different sources and examples, and some help from my tutors, I got the application running. 

## Installation
In order to install the code for this application, you'll need node.js and some sort of text editor. Run npm i in the commandline and then nodemon if you have it, for easy editing with a server. Then run npm start in the commandline to start up the server and open up your browser onto localhost:3002/ 
## Usage
To use this application, click the get started button to go to the notes part of the application.

My tutor Eric, and some repositories from other bootcamps for the same assignment, I probably looked at at least 20.
